  - Crash Course Computing
- Backend 101
  - Understand how web servers work
  - Deploying websites to the cloud
- Expected Outcome
  - Able to solve [basic algorithm problems on freecodecamp](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/basic-algorithm-scripting/). Select the
    first 5 problems and complete the solution - Part 1

### Month 2 -----------------------
- Programming Logic 102
  - Codeacademy Modules (5- 8)
  - Learn what is a class, methods and functions
  - Understand the concept of recursive function
  - Understand what is Big O Notation
- Computer Science 102

- Build your own personal website with HTML + CSS [Sample Site to follow](https://colorlib.com/preview/#jackson)

### Month 3 (Mentor Led) ----------------------
## Building a todo app 
*In this month, we run through how an entire app works, from the frontend, to the backend to deploying it to the cloud. Running through the whole steps gives you the bigger picture and idea of how apps work. Sure you may not understand parts of it, but getting the bigger picutre and idea gives you a strong foundation and goal to work on. It sets you the roadmap of what you need to do to get a basic web application up and running.*
- Building the Frontend *Build the entire frontend of the todo app with javascript*
  - HTML 
    - Input box
    - Dropdown box
    - List of todos
  - CSS
    - Styling the code
  - Javascript / Vuejs
    - Showing my completed todos
    - Showing my pending todos
    - Showing my deleted todos

- Deploying it to the cloud

- Hosting your app on digitalocean

- Database Intgration
  - Google Firebase

- Handling User Authentication (login/logout) 
  - Login / logout

### Month 4 -----------------------

- Solve Google Code Jam problem [Foregone Problem](http://tiny.cc/foregone-solution)

### Month 5 -----------------------
- Make a todo application with Javascript + Jquery [Reference](https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_js_todolist.asp)
- Complete all javascript modules on Codeacademy and able to solve all problems without assistance

### Month 6 -----------------------
- Hacking Kali Linux
  *The key to being a great coder is understanding the fundamentals of servers and opearting systems, which is Linux. The big chunk of software applications today run on Linux OS, and knowledge of this OS is key to being able to deploy and run your applications. The best way to learn something is to hack it.*
